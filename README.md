# Color Comparison Tool

This application allows you to easily compare colors with an existing database of colors. Whether the colors are defined
as SCSS variables or CSS variables, you can load all relevant files into the application using a simple drag-and-drop
feature.

### Key Features:

1. **File Upload**: Drag and drop your SCSS or CSS files directly onto the application's homepage to load your color
   definitions.
2. **Color Search**: Effortlessly search for colors, especially useful when designers provide new pages with slightly
   different color variations.
3. **Enhanced Workflow**: Quickly identify color discrepancies to ensure design consistency across projects.

### How to Use:

1. Drag and drop your SCSS or CSS files onto the application's homepage.
2. Once the files are loaded, use the search function to locate and compare colors.
3. Click on any color in the color list to view detailed information, including matched colorsâ€”these are identical
   colors that may have different variable names.

This tool streamlines color management and helps maintain a consistent design system, even when handling incremental
updates or new designs.
